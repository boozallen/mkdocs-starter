## Tables

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
!!! tip
    Tables are kind of a pain in markdown.
    This [tool](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) can help to generate your markdown tables for you. 

    The [Markdown Table Prettifier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=darkriszty.markdown-table-prettify) extension for VS Code is also pretty great.
